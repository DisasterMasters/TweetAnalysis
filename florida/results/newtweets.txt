Curfew the state! The scourge make our country look bad looting. They already receive food stamps, welfare, free housing! Criminals!

. @FLPD411 arrested 9 people caught by @WPLGLocal10 cameras looting Fort Lauderdale businesses despite the weather. http:// bit.ly/2eWc6Z0

I think they are currently laying away in the county jail. Prior to the LA riots this was referred to as stealing, now its looting.

@WPLGLocal10 @wsvn since there Hispanics their not looting they're trying to survive pic.twitter.com/KLJNJML7r6

They've been looting all there life as will there kids and there kids or if someone kills them this will stop.

What does 99% of the looting videos have in common? What was the race? They have no respect for anyone.

Yes it is, but how does that justify looting? Also, insurance claims raise costs for everyone else, it's not victimless

But we're the racists for pointing out that it seems to be only black people doing the looting. js

I was so impressed with Texas for having no looting during a hurricane. Not in my state. I knew fellow Floridians would make me ashamed.

Miami doesn't deserve power with all the morons looting take care of people who deserve it.

Good, becuase white people are looting too

They are not looting because they are black; poor character is color bind.. https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=48dF7n v_rC8 …

Why is it alway dumb White people looting?

Merely pointing out how readily you minimalised the crime of looting. I hope you can feel this liberal" if u ever become a victim of crime"

A video is worth a thousand words. Nothing new here, riots , blackouts and other natural disasters means looting time. Time for new Nikes

so-are we not supposed to notice it's all black people doing the looting? But they complain about unfair profiling...

OMG! Did you see all those white people looting?

OMG! Did you see all those white people looting?

Not all black ppl are looters, but all theses ppl are black. Just saying. Find a video where you see ppl looting and their not black

I don't see black people or white people doing the looting .. I just see criminal scum.

I don't understand how stupid people defending criminals white or blacks they are looting period.

@WPLGLocal10 busted schmucks looting a Florida shoestore as #HurricaneIrma ravished Fla. @nypost http:// nyp.st/2wjDOFi

I am not surprised black people were caught looting... because THUG CULTURE promotes it. IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH FOR YOU ???

If you arent looting...then he was not talking about YOU. If you feel some sort of kinship to them..then YOU should feel ashamed.

surprised they are not looting the MM dispensaries

Character matters.. looting, stealing shoes during a category 4 hurricane reveals who you are & what your priorities are.. it is clear.

Wow, the race card thrown re a vid showing blacks looting!! Incredible!! It's always the white guys fault, isn't?

Because they're black & they're looting. What can't you understand? When was the last time you were on Sunrise & Powerline??

@WPLGLocal10 It is great to see even the low life #thugs of Fort Lauderdale working together to save #tennisshoes https:// twitchy.com/jacobb-38/2017 /09/10/meanwhile-in-fort-lauderdale-it-looks-as-if-looting-is-well-underway/?utm_campaign=socialflow_twit

Back years ago looting was as low as you get,and you would & could be shot,especially if the National Guard was called & curfew was imposed

How many Trump voters out looting other's property?

Doesn't matter what color or nationality you are the looting is wrong. It just seems to be the same type of people that continue doing it.

. @WPLGLocal10 FL City police: Six men arrested after looting local business.

There was very little looting in Texas.

For the next hurricane, position National Guard troops around all shoe stores, looting problem solved.

Reparations looting.

This looting isn't a race issue. It's a criminal justice issue - identify and prosecute.

Racist? Because black people are looting?

Blacks not being shot dead for looting I think u mean. Why do you Americans give them so much, when they give back so little.

I'm sure somewhere whites are looting too

This looting pales in comparison to the looting Mnuchin, Ryan and Trump are planning to pull on the American people via tax reform.

Do a YouTube search for looting". If you've got a keen eye

@deray Is that BLM looting?

Blacks are only ones looting in this video,do you have another video with whites looting, or is your comment just about racial profiling?

The usual demographic of thugs looting their own community...

No joke looting a Barnes & Noble sounds amazing!

Before i clicked on this i wondered if it was gonna be black people looting lol #HurrcaneIrma

When it is looting, it is prison time. Lil Didndonuffins are always innocent aren't they?

No, she's making fun of leftists who say that looting is a black people thing so punishing looters is racist. I hate explaining jokes

Watching @WPLGLocal10 and they say Ft. Lauderdale Police have arrested those caught looting the closed shoe store.

Of course because it's the same faces always looting and decent society is sick of it, no wonder they are still slaves on the government tit

This makes me sick. #looting #hurricaneirma2017 @WPLGLocal10 thanks for covering this. https:// twitter.com/laricachona/st atus/906965498365083649 …

Honest black Americans must be horribly embarrassed & pissed off that it is ALWAYS, ALWAYS black thugs looting

No they're looting because they're low iq blacks

While the looting was going on the mother yanks her son back out of the store. Mama knows best. May God bless Florida.

I never see any other race than blacks looting stores. I find that interesting and sad at the same time. Maybe its all the news reports?

Did you watch the video? They're looting a clothing store.

Are you okay with the looting?

@zeynep @WPLGLocal10 is this isolated or are you seeing reports of it happening all over Southern Florida? #HurricaineIrma #looting https:// twitter.com/julian5news/st atus/906945273636716550 …

It's pouring rain, in a major hurricane, and these ghetto rats are looting a Foot Locker. Classy. #DarwinAwards #HurricaneIrma

Nobody had to watch to see who was looting....take that howeever you want!

yeah we be looting the gucci stores around here

They been looting since Katrina.

It's the same as when people were looting in LA or NO. We want to be known as a good community of good people

I would agree that they're stealing to survive if they were looting food, water, and medical supplies instead of shoes and clothes.

WTF are you talking about? They aren't looting because they're black. They're looting because they are criminals.

Why would you show black people and imply they were looting that store? That is racist.

Don't be embarrassed. They're not looting bc they're black. They're looting bc of their bad character.

It's not being racist when you're watching a video of black people looting. It's a fact here, black people are looting.

Blacks already stated looting... figures. You loot, we shoot!

Black people looting? What a shocker.

Just because these BLACK ppl are looting, it's okay for people to say this? @WPLGLocal10 you need to do some control https://www. facebook.com/WPLGLocal10/vi deos/10154893990383837/ … pic.twitter.com/QZHxodmACY

Liberals would say it's okay to loot essentials. I guess some new Jordans are essential after you soak the old ones while looting

You could literally use this footage for every single looting event EVER

Arent2 the ppl looting creating the stereotype?

Their looting creates the stereotype.

Are we allowed to point out the ethnicity? Or is that bad? Maybe looting is a cultural thing!!

LMAO RT @AndySlater : LIVE looting on @WPLGLocal10 . Unbelievable. #HurricaneIrma pic.twitter.com/OIdEtSPqEs
