No change to forecast. We have always been in the cone for a hurricane - hurricane force winds expected in all of CFL. More at 4am @wesh,3,09/08/2017
That's not what I said. Best case would be WELL east of FL with NO impact. Also Matthew would PALE in comparison to a direct hit from Irma.,3,09/06/2017
Depends on WHERE in South FL it lands and what category it is at landfall. It would lose some steam. My best guess is a Cat 1 or 2.,3,09/06/2017

False information? About no tsunami? I'm a bit lost with your reply...,11,09/11/2017
"NO, NO, NO...this surge will NOT be like a tsunami. High surge? Yes. Tsunami force & speed...absolutely NOT!",6,09/10/2017
"And that's what I was trying to get folks to understand. Not to say surge won't be bad, but not as some were saying it would rush"" in.""",3,09/10/2017
"Took about 2.5 hrs to rise 6 ft, based on NOAA data. Point was, people were acting as though this huge wall of water was going to pour in.",11,09/10/2017
"Yes, sir. But mechanics play a huge role in how fast and at what strength. Thanks for the correction!",11,09/10/2017
"By comparatively, we'll see Tampa inundated w/storm surge over the next several hours, but don't expect to see a large 15-ft wave crash in.",11,09/10/2017
"I hope not! With a setup like this, it should be a gradual rise (comparatively). Shouldn't be inundated as fast as a tsunami. My thoughts.",11,09/10/2017
"And, again, I think those walking out on the receded beach are nuts...for the record.",11,09/10/2017
"We're talking 10-15 foot surge over hours, not minutes as a tsunami would do.",3,09/10/2017
"It most certainly will, but not in grand, tsunami fashion. As the wind shifts, it will begin and get worse as the storm approaches.",3,09/10/2017
"I never implied it was ok. But to cry, Tsunami! Run!""",11,09/10/2017
"I, for one, would not be walking on the beach. No one could tell exactly you how much the wind needs to shift b4 the water moves back in.",11,09/10/2017
"This shouldn't be political. Yes, surge will come. Inches to several feet as winds shift. But, to fear monger a tsunami is coming is false.",11,09/10/2017
High tide for Tampa area is around 2:30am EDT. The water will start rising before then. This will NOT cause tsunami-type waves. Surge: yes.,11,09/10/2017
"Well, now the NWS says a matter of minutes. I'd be surprised. The surge will come, but it will start creeping first as the wind dir changes.",11,09/10/2017
"No, it won't rush back in. It will take some time once the wind direction changes for the storm surge to peak.",11,09/10/2017
It's not going to rush in like a tsunami. This phenomenon occurs because of the strength of the hurricane and wind direction.,3,09/10/2017

Honestly you make very good points..the whole slab is going to be soaking wet thus all everything touching it is going to be wet too,11,09/10/2017
I've spent the last 10 years learning about water containment for waterproofing so please don't tell me I have ZERO knowledge in this,11,09/10/2017
From unbonding to concrete. Letting water sit is what causes the massive amount of damage if you can keep flood waters at bay.,11,09/10/2017

How about the areas with no damage? The street lights on Bell Blvd were on last night yet the residents are still w/o power. @GabrielleNBC2,3,09/13/2017

But he has competent people handling his twitter. Why doesn't LCEC?,6,09/14/2017
Well if you hired a professional social media publicity person who knows how to do the job instead of your kid it would have been done,11,09/14/2017
Exactly. They should hire a professional to handle public media not a little kid with no experience and a connected father,11,09/14/2017
Do you want me to request out of state aid for power restoration since you are so busy tweeting insults to your customers and need help?,11,09/14/2017
Maybe you guys should request help from out of state power companies since you are so overwhelmed? They had power in NY in 3 days re Sandy,11,09/14/2017
Maybe you should ask for help from power companies up north They had Staten Island up with power in 3 days after Sandy,11,09/14/2017
Where is a map or you power grid?,11,09/14/2017
I'll make you a kiddy meal,11,09/14/2017
No problem. I'll even donate some of my defrosted burgers from my deep freezer,11,09/14/2017
Hey no problem I have refrozen burger to donate too,11,09/14/2017
I'll make you a burger,11,09/14/2017
I've already checked all the lines in our grid All clear,11,09/14/2017
No im actually volunteering in the locations that will be supplying them food today,3,09/14/2017
I know that. You can't even get someone to respond professionally on twitter so why would I expect lcec executive to schedule repairs right,11,09/14/2017
Maybe I should go over and turn it back on myself?,11,09/14/2017
"Sanibel has many workers who live off island, Who don't have power and are angry. They are the ones who cook and clean for the tourists",11,09/14/2017
Salaries get paid from local taxes as well. There are more residents in Cape than in Sanibel,3,09/14/2017
All the residents trust me,11,09/14/2017
So it's ok to screw over the residents for money? Tourists don't vote our local politicians should Remember that come Nov. I'll remind,11,09/14/2017
pic.twitter.com/tob0F0KY55,6,09/14/2017
I notice how you keep ignoring the fact that Sanibel is getting power first when Cape has less damage,3,09/14/2017
And you continue to act like a child,11,09/14/2017
Alfred e Newman wannabe ho back to making crappy remixes and let the adults talk,11,09/14/2017
They are doing their jobs but not in our location They had numerous crews working in Sanibel where all the politicians live none in Cape,11,09/14/2017
Hope they enjoyed that food at remax last night pic.twitter.com/pxnJROaxFS,3,09/14/2017
The weir behind my house has power ....,11,09/14/2017
I saw that one person in Cape spliced of a light pole and was able to give power to 4 homes,11,09/14/2017
I worked for them for years and I understand how it works. Political pressure dictates who get power first,11,09/14/2017
Exactly. I did see numerous crews working in Sanibel yesterday though,11,09/14/2017
82 thousand in Cape Coral. Maybe we need our own power company?,11,09/13/2017
I can't understand what you trying to say. The statement is incoherent no lines down in my area. No damage to transformers. Hmmmm?,11,09/13/2017
Umm. I worked for a power company up north before retiring. Same thing there. Restoration to local politicians and bigwigs come first,11,09/13/2017
"Instead of leaving, restore it while you are there instead of coming back for it later. Local politicians have power",11,09/13/2017
What a coincidence that all the local politicians have power first?,11,09/13/2017
Um by turning it back on ? Grid by grid and not skipping to run to other areas before finishing the areas they are in first?,3,09/13/2017

Lcec. Too bad you can't stay professional. I definitely will be making a formal complaint on your antagonist and unprofessional behavior,11,09/13/2017
And people back then didn't live to be 80 or older and have to suffer in this Heat funny how the politicians all have power back first,11,09/13/2017
No really? Btw Sanibel is all restored I'm fine but all the elderly neighbors here are hurting and I have to listen to idiots w excuses,11,09/13/2017
Lol. Hundreds of trucks? Can I get some of what you're smoking?,11,09/13/2017
May I suggest just saying no to drugs?,6,09/13/2017
Exactly. Anyone know who this wise ass is?,3,09/13/2017
I bet your home has power though,11,09/13/2017
Yeah like determining which area gets power first after the phones calls for favors start coming in,11,09/13/2017
Run an extension cord,11,09/13/2017
Todd also said that he gets randomly drunk off Yoo-hoo in his quote. Want to want he said again?,3,09/13/2017
Wow that's so professional! Mind if I retweet this to the news?,11,09/13/2017
Might be a good story here for the press,11,09/13/2017
Not a conspiracy but selective restoration is the the politically correct term I see that there is power 4 all the local politicians block,3,09/13/2017
I understand how the grid system works. Used to work for power company up north,11,09/13/2017
I'm in northwest cape and they have had power two blocks away since yesterday n we still don't. Drive around and no damage to poles in grid,3,09/13/2017
Have to run extension cords for two blocks to get power,11,09/13/2017
