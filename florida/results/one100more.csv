Tips To Keep You And Your Family Safe During Hurricane Irma https://www. wuft.org/news/2017/09/1 0/tips-to-keep-you-and-your-family-safe-during-hurricane-irma/#.WbVMGRQqFxw.twitter …,0
True. But what they are doing is protected under the 1st amendment. They have the right to protest. Even if you do not agree or respect it.,1
Why would they leave their pets in kennels like that They could have been injured or killed They had shelters for people with pets,1
"To alll the people saying people out the people are crazy, that's me and @delaneynipper and yes we are",1
I don't think that's Key West. The people there say it's not that bad yet.,1
"A police officer telling a white person that they only shoot black people"" is obvs not a terrible joke.""",1
That’s because they are punished for a crime they committed! So yea good try on the whole “oh black ppl kill black ppl” phrase clown,1
Why ? Because they are kneeling for unjustified murders by unarmed black people ? Actually look at why they are doing it,1
Yeah that’s totally what they’re doing I bet they’re arresting people too,1
Maybe they will lower their prices . That would be helpful to the people that DO NOT have that extra money for their prices,1
5 things that have changed about FEMA since Katrina – and 5 that haven't http://www. fox10tv.com/story/36356863 /5-things-that-have-changed-about-fema-since-katrina-and-5-that-havent …,1
What the NFL and Players don’t realize is what #POTUS is saying is what the American Citizens are thinking. Not at work “POLITICS “ we don’t,1
They'd have more power restored if they didn't have over 50 trucks parked at the state Fairgrounds. Guess what? We don't have power yet.,1
Me too. Their idea is that they are covered by insurance. No big deal if they drown. All they care about is the money. Greedy evil morons.,1
"It is Irma related, only people that are at the game are retired people that live out there and rich people. No normal person is gonna go",1
"Curfew the state! The scourge make our country look bad looting. They already receive food stamps, welfare, free housing! Criminals!",1
They're not disrespecting the flag. It's not about the flag at all. It's a protest against racism and police violence against black people.,1
When? That's the problem. People need help now. FEMA can't help until they get orders. People are dying. Why the delay?,1
"As an alt right nationalist, I hope more of them do it so that White people realize exactly what black people think of them.",1
@ian693 @The_Phinstones @WPLGLocal10 @FinsBroadcaster please retweet they are blocking people who need rooms because they are FEMA people https:// twitter.com/debbieluvsport s/status/908850601395675136 …,1
But we're the racists for pointing out that it seems to be only black people doing the looting. js,1
Is it flooded? Because what if people only had enough money or provisions for the weekend? What do they do? Let them go home if they want,1
This does not reflect on you! If it was a bunch of white people I would not be embarrassed. The reflection is on these people as people!!!,1
This does not reflect on you! If it was a bunch of white people I would not be embarrassed. The reflection is on these people as people!!!,1
They are not looting because they are black; poor character is color bind.. https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=48dF7n v_rC8 …,1
black lives matter black lives matter black lives matter black lives oh oh wait ahhhhhahahlolsmhhahaha,1
think that is what they want you to feel they show you what they want u to think in case a son of a official is doing it don't let it,1
"ALL RACES OF PEOPLE COMMIT CRIMES SOME RACE PAYOFF TO NOT ADVERTISE FAMILIES FACE PEOPLE ARE ALL PEOPLE many KILL,STEAL,ROB,they do the same",1
"They're not Africans, they're black Americans doing what they're taught at home.",1
so-are we not supposed to notice it's all black people doing the looting? But they complain about unfair profiling...,1
I don't see black people or white people doing the looting .. I just see criminal scum.,1
I don't understand how stupid people defending criminals white or blacks they are looting period.,1
they give the black people bad names themselves don't need white people to say anything,1
I am not surprised black people were caught looting... because THUG CULTURE promotes it. IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH FOR YOU ???,1
CNN would defend this..MSNBC would defend this...they would say that they are not WHITE SUPREMACISTS and they didnt kill anyone.,1
Not all black people r thieves but that is what this particular video shows. But more than that is how low these individuals r that do it.,1
So because a few people want to steal from a store then the whole community of black people don't matter?,1
Because they're black & they're looting. What can't you understand? When was the last time you were on Sunrise & Powerline??,1
People like that give black people a bad name,1
That's what you CHOOSE to see. White people steal too. Just like they stole this country.,1
Doesn't matter what color or nationality you are the looting is wrong. It just seems to be the same type of people that continue doing it.,1
"they choose to do that at their own discretion. they don't just go around killing people and sterilizing people, can't blame blacks",1
I'm not embarrassed to be black. They do not represent me. These are just thieves who need to be thrown in jail. They have bad character.,1
"Blacks are only ones looting in this video,do you have another video with whites looting, or is your comment just about racial profiling?",1
Those are not black people. Those are the perfect definition of a #Niggers sorry but it is what it is. Trust me most of my friends are AA,1
"When it is looting, it is prison time. Lil Didndonuffins are always innocent aren't they?",1
"No, she's making fun of leftists who say that looting is a black people thing so punishing looters is racist. I hate explaining jokes",1
"Honest black Americans must be horribly embarrassed & pissed off that it is ALWAYS, ALWAYS black thugs looting",1
The African Americans get a bad rep because OF people like you who spread false lies They only get a bad rep because the White Media allowIt,1
WTF are you talking about? They aren't looting because they're black. They're looting because they are criminals.,1
I don't think people who loot shops sit on any end of a political spectrum. They don't care about that stuff.,1
Why would you show black people and imply they were looting that store? That is racist.,1
"I don't think only black people steal, I just don't see any white people in this video.",1
Don't be embarrassed. They're not looting bc they're black. They're looting bc of their bad character.,1
"It's not being racist when you're watching a video of black people looting. It's a fact here, black people are looting.",1
Black people looting? What a shocker.,1
"Just because these BLACK ppl are looting, it's okay for people to say this? @WPLGLocal10 you need to do some control https://www. facebook.com/WPLGLocal10/vi deos/10154893990383837/ … pic.twitter.com/QZHxodmACY",1
Such an unnecessary racist comment. U think black people are the only ones who steal? I'm 100% black & I hate looters!,1
"People understand we're looking at a small group of people taking criminal advantage of a crisis, and that bad people come in all colors.",1
Are we allowed to point out the ethnicity? Or is that bad? Maybe looting is a cultural thing!!,1
"It is more than ridiculous, it is highway robbery, and it is sad. It is a necessity so this is what they do. I tell you humanity!",1
It is odd that where the press is there is FPL..maybe drive down streets with no power ..talk to the people with no power see how they feel,1
Why. Why? WHY?!! What the hell is wrong with these people? Why punish the helpless. I hate that I share a world with such inhuman people.,1
This makes me sick! People that are doing this deserve to be chained to a tree thru the hurricane. Let them see how they would handle it.,1
"If they don't have cods, they can also make their fish & chips from baramundi. Australians actually swear that it is a superior fish.",1
"Yeah, because only Black people commit crime against other Black people, right?",1
"They are the shittiest looking, smelling and performing people in Florida. They look like the people you see caught with drugs on COPS tv",1
"I thought 90% of homes were destroyed-is that only Key West? I don't get it. Is it money, embarrassment, Or fear of pissed-off citizens?",1
Not if these lowlife's think they can steal what's not theirs. They deserve it. Stealing is one of the lowest forms of crime there is.,1
Cmon why is it whoever steals in the news it got to be black people this is why some people don't like them(I have many black they are nice),1
"People are just people.If there is no authorities around they take advantage. Now ,where is the true Honesty and trust of Human Beings",1
I really don't fucking care that they stole some damn shoes. Tf? Bet you the ones they're wearing are the only ones they have.,1
"Because they are thieves! Why do they need to steal shoes? Because they are pieces of shit, that's why! Shoot them!",1
Damn white people always looting and always taking advantage of people...,1
"Ratings. They have to make it look dangerous or exciting, not boring. That's what people like to watch.",1
"Why is it always black people? Make you look bad. If you want respect, act like it.",1
Let's see 1 idiot shot a group of black people in a black church and has been denounced by every conservative. It was horrible & so sad.,1
It is what it is. They are WHO they are. It's what they do. Opportunistic Assholes.,1
not looting it's stealing looting is in a time of crises people go for the things then need ''food/water and so on'' their not doing that,1
The camera person is racist he is only filming the black people ! #disgusting,1
"They need to be rounded up and prosecuted. If they would take advantage of this, what else are they doing? Looks like bad people",1
Let it have been white people stealing oh they are just poor or troubled... cut them some slack YALL REALLY FULL OF IT,1
"If they are running into cars, that means they have a home, and it's not out of necessity that they steal. They're just criminals!!",1
I don't give a damn it is what we see! This cannot be disputed! It is not Racist to be honest!,1
Why is it always blacks looting? Is that in their DNA to Rob?,1
It doesnt give anyone the right to steal just bc the merch MAY have been lost. And fyi people are also stealing from homes. Is that ok too?,1
"Agree, Eddie. But as I just mentioned, we see mostly one race looting, possibly because they are videotaped more often?? Any looter is BAD!",1
"Honestly, most looting videos you see are black people. THAT DOESN'T MEAN more blacks loot. But people see similar videos & become biased. ?",1
"Exactly is just shoes , plus the people that make them in china make $3 per day.. this are kids that need education ...",1
@ESPNBooger why is the police always picking on black people they're just protecting those shoe from the Hurricane,1
Do you think that's the only thing they are stealing? What's the point of stealing shoes? What are they bringing to the world?,1
"Sad part is, they're only doing it cuz A they're stupid as fuck.. and B, they saw other people doing it",1
Why are you only showing black people? White people loot.,1
"When it is looting, it is prison time. Lil Didndonuffins are always innocent aren't they?",1
What is of importance is if that prison has not been evacuated. If that crane comes down on it ...,1
"not saying it's good they're left up, just saying it's uneasonable & to expect poor people to risk life at rich people's command.",1
What about these old people that won't evacuate Because we don't have Enough pet shelters Texas loves their pets more than Florida,1
yea because people resell them outside of the same Home Depot. I saw people doing that already.,1
Racist? We are talking about a dog not about what race he is. What the is wrong with people these days...,1
That's what I'm getting at here. It's time to make sure that these people don't get free speech. They're Nazis. Nazis don't get that.,1
"It is not a curfew, but it is a strong suggestion. People should remain in place until after the storm tomorrow. We will have a better idea",1
