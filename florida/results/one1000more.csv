"Can't tell if it was full blown assault, or if he lunged at her after damaging property which is a criminal mischief. Gonna rewind it.",11
"I'm a veteran, get over it. The initial protest was abt police shooting unarmed BM, not Veterans.",11
"Sometimes, Mr President act like a d*ck, because he don't wanna spend money in a country that already bankrupted",11
Trump is right! #MAGA,11
Disagree w/her! He served his time & deserves integration back into society. What is she saying abt the penal system then? Reject everybody?,11
that is so sad,11
Eh. If women are being forced then help/rescue them. If they've chosen it for themselves then why not respect their choice?,11
aww that is so sad,11
Shocker trump failed again. What's it like constantly being a failure ?,11
Wasn’t me that was a experimental home built helicopter that’s out by Tampa isn’t it ?,11
What causes that condtion,11
But what they have done has lead to violence. What these players are doing is not violent.,11
True. But what they are doing is protected under the 1st amendment. They have the right to protest. Even if you do not agree or respect it.,11
that is so sad,11
What a disgusting person...,11
Means I'm really cranky that it's still so darn hot. Missing fall. Every year.,11
Multiple rivers are doing that same thing right now.,11
That is most certainly frightening.,11
@washingtonpost guess I'll get it free here,11
I guess Cuba is lucky today......,11
So this is actually happening. These people cannot take much more.,11
@10NewsWTSP Any ideas why Spectrum cable TV is still out at 11:00 pm? Power returned at 9:42 am.,11
That's what I'm talkin' about!! @iamthatalex TPD > GPD,11
That is awesome @TampaPD,11
WHAT? WHY?? wow. What's wrong with people?!?,11
@10NewsWTSP Channel 10 spreading lies saying @DukeEnergy is working 24 hrs a day. Duke Energy admitted stopping at 2100,11
Why would they leave their pets in kennels like that They could have been injured or killed They had shelters for people with pets,11
They need help on alafia right now,11
Nah !! He looks more like a Trump supporter,11
"I got the same message at 1:44 pm. It's a beautiful day, but I guess they can't assess umder perfect conditions.",11
"Right? These idiots are not even doing a rolling stop , just barreling through",11
@10NewsWTSP who is that talking on the radio right now?,11
What a Tsunami WOULD LOOK like,11
@10NewsWTSP tv audio is cutting out,11
Those look like they could've been used for dog fighting. Hope they're in safer hands.,11
What is a director hit?,11
That is theft!,11
Does that mean it could make landfall near the panhandle?,11
The guy talking right now is giving worthless info,11
Why is no one mentioning what happened with Matthew last year?,11
Why does this graphic look sexy,11
What is this fool talking about?,11
"Looks familiar. Pretty incredible how they're doing what they're doing, Isn't it?",11
What is happening here?,11
What does that mean? (eyewall replacement cycle),11

Torture them!! Disgusting people,11

", why does it look like Lynda is using a cup and not a mug? She needs something special",11
Everything is covered!!!,11
Two wrongs don’t make a right....,11
"John Katzanjian, Palm Beach County Benelovent Association: This is a big (paradigm) shift that I've never seen before.""""",11
"Jacquelyn Jameson: My son is not a victim, he is a survivor.",11
"The pastor says what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong.""""",11
People act like boats got brakes,11
Yes it is disrespectful,11
Cops like yourself do not get enough attention so I greatly appreciate it but some officers make law enforcement look evil an some have,11
By a black person or a Spanish person gets shot by a Spanish person,11
That’s because they are punished for a crime they committed! So yea good try on the whole “oh black ppl kill black ppl” phrase clown,11
Why ? Because they are kneeling for unjustified murders by unarmed black people ? Actually look at why they are doing it,11
"Red Cross responded. 5 people, including 1 child, getting assistance.",11
Yup kim jong un got it right he’s a DOTARD,11
Why don' they get this fixed ????,11
He is dead ? We care about this why ?,11

Why aren't TV channels reporting on AT&T Uverse outage?,11
"Wait, it's Friday? It's felt like Monday, every day, for the past 12 days.",11
@CBS12 Just saw at least 3 helicopters heading west toward Royal Palm. Any idea why?,11
Yeah that’s totally what they’re doing I bet they’re arresting people too,11
That's just sad. Sad. Sad,11
Lies lies lies,11
Blocking traffic because they can an nobody will dare question them,11
Make sure people know what FPL is telling the public is not accurate. They've even lost data reported on their web outage reporting site.,11
Where exactly is that?,11
"Haverhill/Tower Park area, yes, got it back last night at 7pm",11
What is wrong with her right eye?,11
"Roosevelt Bridge is under inspection-Hobe Sound Bridge is NOT operational.""-MC EOC""",11
It is really bad here now!,11
How is it now? What's damage? Left town,11
What channel is it on directtv?,11
"What website, can't get it",11
It is ignorance rather than stupidity!,11

Is that Iraq?,11
I think that estimate is low.,11
Wth is THIS? I've seen no other forecasts that look like this!,11
What property is this?,11
Hey I hope it doesn't hit anybody. I love Florida. Let's make sure people get out safely,11
"Stand down. If someone thinks a forecast is a guarantee, they've spent their life disappointed.",11
"Hi morning, it is the same story! forecast cone does not update until 11am",11
Wait....what?? That's right over us!,11
"Wow, its crazy right now. I'm just hoping it loses strength before it hits us",11
That looks bad.,11
What about that cold front that is coming down.,11
Even though they say we are getting a cold front they still won't talk about it.,11
I thought it wouldn't hit until Sunday or Monday.....,11
What is its speed? (mph...not wind speed),11
Sun is shinning in Boynton Beach right now,11

"Doesn't sound like they were prepared. Maybe less time on tv, more time planning?",11
like why?!?,11
That is not good.,11
I bet it was because fpl didn't make it on time,11
"Probably the same idiots blowing through intersections that have non-working traffic lights...This me first"" mentality is getting old",11
"then they get upset at stereo types"" ! But they create their own fame smh""",11
I saw wonderful Americans helping people who need it ! F**K those Looters !,11
"Man what Fpl doing people don't have power in North Lauderdale, Pompano Beach, Coral Springs I thought they was prepare",11
I don't frankly care if they don't like the word. #community,11
what about HOA trees that they planted? what if they are dangerously leaning over roots unsturdy? big ficus trees?,11
Hey a white man talking about savages. Yea man ur totally not a racist coward.,11
Leaving FL altogether. Why is @insideFPL treating those who help them worse than prisoners? These ppl are heroes! Give them a hot meal FFS,11
"Yes, is like a tornado heat Aventura",11
Yes he is good,11
they look like hard working americans to me.,11
"If White Supremacy isn't a color issue, pray tell what exactly is it?",11
Low lives doing what they do best.,11
They're saving those shoes! Lol,11
"that's because Miami is like the 3rd world, look around",11
"Pretty sure this isn't what Martin Luther King Jr was talking about when he gave his  I have a dream speech""!""",11
This is so disgusting! Struggle is not fun...stealing is so mean!,11
What streets is that on?,11
Watching @wsvn like who is this random hot guy ? It's @TameraMowryTwo husband,11
I say make them eat whatever they stole.,11
Then they wonder why cops single them out lol,11
"If ur implying that I'm""a racist get ur facts straight b4u ""ASS""-UME! I meant that law for EVERY RACE! Who's the racist here?! (cont)""",11
And they still don't understand why people think BLM is a ridiculous joke!,11
They were just making sure those poor shoes didn't get damaged. True American heroes!,11
Looks like they're just hangin out,11
These people have nicer cars and now nicer shoes than me,11
Yes I agree that stealing is wrong. I could possibly make the case that if food was being taken perhaps that's what happens in an emergency,11
"What is clear is that dishonest ppl assert one incident is widespread"". That is: dishonest.""",11
Disgusting. I hope they get caught.,11
License plate numbers should be helpful. What's up with that sick obsession with sneakers. How does anyone want shoes THAT BAD.,11
"damn I really haven't swam in a while cause that pool"" looks hella appealing right about now""",11
Is that a pay phone? I hate when historical monuments get destroyed.,11
"They're just rescuing the shoes, what's the big deal? #lockemup",11
Idiots! Make sure when they ask for hurricane assistance they get zero!!!,11
SHOOOTTT them right now!,11
"It definitely looks like they're stealing shoes, since that's basically what Foot Locker has. And socks. And maybe some insoles.",11
"People under this post saying kill them. For STEALING? Yes punish them, but killing is over the top and unnecessary.",11
"They say I'm a white supremacist. I've never stolen anything, so that does make me a better person and I'm glad they recognize it.",11
"Yes, that's right confused Alt-Left Sociopath.",11
What the fuck is that green thing,11
It's good they were arrested...,11
Greed is often short-sighted. Gonna cost them more now than if they'd taken it down.,11
"Why is it always black people? Make you look bad. If you want respect, act like it.",11
People will drown too. Should they preemptively drown people?,11
It's heartbreaking that such beauty is gone.,11
"Um, who is surprised? This is basically routine...",11
It is what it is. They are WHO they are. It's what they do. Opportunistic Assholes.,11
Black people make me sick.,11
I hope they get what they deserve!,11
Disgraceful & pathetic. That's what their life is worth- sneakers,11
Should've left them in a cage outside,11
Is that a serious question?,11
Looks like White Supremacist are at it again,11
"Absolutely, seeing it continue even with cameras pointed at them just seems like humanity taking another step backwards",11
It's probably happened more than what the news cameras have caught,11
What ..they Black ?,11
I don't get it? Why shoes?,11
"If they can afford a brand new F150, they don't get a pass on stealing. Stop making excuses.",11
That's why the sneakers are so expensive! And if they're broke they should get a job. Doesn't look like they're stealing WORK boots!,11
That is scary.,11
Oh that's sad.,11
WLS white lives shooting (churches that is!),11
"@ShaunKing , i guess it was a white man that sent them in for shoes, huh?",11
They got caught,11
they're scumbags who are using this disaster as an opportunity!! Shoot them bastards!,11
Whoa... is that a payphone???,11
Wonder how they'd feel if their home got looted and every thing they own including their undies get taken...,11
Why shoot them? Deterrence,11
Is that a pay phone ? Lol,11
They got arrested already,11
Omg it looks like a river running through Brickell,11
"I'm at home eating twizzlers don't get punched after this storm ed with these people"" stealing isn't a race thing it's a moral thing""",11
"What color r thosepeople?!"" Fucking animals! Then they're 1st ones to cry""why nobody like us?!""""",11
"Hmmmm, I'm not saying a word.",11
You didn't say it was wrong! Shooting is crazy but you're making it sound like what they're doing isn't soo bad bc no one is getting hurt,11
What color were they?,11
Omg that is hilarious...,11
Black lives Matter doing what they do best !,11
Which I agree with. I just want them charged. Because it's not right even if it is only shoes.,11
Despicable is right. No plea-bargain's! Max punishment is needed.,11
That's what I've been saying why shoot if they can just be charged with theft,11
"Shut it yourself, nobody owes them free stolen merch.",11
Which had nothing to do with what I said! I said does stealing shoes make it right? No. It doesn't.,11
One man's street fish is another man's dinner. Or something like that.,11
@Trish_Entin they want a closer look,11
Why the hell are they chasing a storm that's chasing them,11
"Exactly is just shoes , plus the people that make them in china make $3 per day.. this are kids that need education ...",11
"nope - gonna shoot someone who steals from other people/businesses. THEFT madam, is a CRIME",11
"getting arrested is not a deterrence, getting shot is!",11
that's not... good day,11
So despicable & vile! They look like they are enjoying themselves! Unbelievable! These are our neighbors!!!,11
Really shoot them? for what being idiots at a time when civility & respect are abandoned they loot a shoe store?Not a place that sells h20?,11
Is people really thinking about shoes right now? Is Ridiculous.,11
Damn right! Sharknado is life!,11
"Take a look sat this @AnnCoulter . Boring, right? Ridiculous gasbag.",11
"Sad part is, they're only doing it cuz A they're stupid as fuck.. and B, they saw other people doing it",11
If they woulda gotten arrested for stealing they would scream racism.. that's what's wrong in this world today. No responsibility,11
I hope they get caught,11
what does it cost now a days to make a call? 5 dollars?,11
How are they making good people look bad? Are they making you look bad? What good people are you talking about?,11
Driving brand new cars N trucks so it isn't like they need to look. Pathetic.,11
Work shoes yea right #LockThemUp,11
"Who fucking cares? Focus on human life, not overpriced shoes.",11
Ugh that doesn't look good.,11
They more than likely did.,11
Hope they get every last one of them...Dumbasses..license plates RIGHT there!!!!!!!,11
Is that water electrocuted? Looks like something is flashing underwater,11
"This is why i moved out that town, people suck. Now i live in beautiful socal.",11

Is that by Old Cutler road?,11
"I dunno. It looks pretty boring, right @AnnCoulter ? Hang tough, Miami.",11
"Wrong, false, fake. This is miami. Not miami beach.",11
What road is that?,11
Yes. Fuck them,11
Make sure they show their faces! Public shaming a must,11
IS THAT A PAYPHONE?!,11
"Wait, is that a phone booth?",11
Wow recently stayed at that hotel. That water is 8-10' high at least,11
Sad people,11
jk he thinks he knows what he's talking about until he experiences the surge,11
"Hey @AnnCoulter , looks like a little more than light rain""",11
God is really sending a message..smh I wish people would get it,11
These Flamingos behaved better than the people at Costco...,11
"What's it like inland, like around Barry College?",11
Facts they getting the new caddy,11
Best believe they were trying to get that insurance money for a new whip. They ALL parked RIGHT underneath little trees.,11
"This is normal, climate change is a hoax created by China",11
Looks like workers should've been getting good hours that week,11
What about other services like YouTube TV? @YouTubeTV,11

"He wants America 1st? Loool , the only thing he thinks abiut is himself & how he can squeeze a buck outta it.",11

This is BS. Miami doesn't look like this.,11
"He's obviously saying that if it's this bad now when they haven't had the eye pass over them, how much worse would it be if it did/does? 2/2",11

They should probably fix that,11
"Sure, it's a slippery slope, but Nazis. Bye. Done. No more Nazis.",11
